# gaia-stellar-halo

This code creates plots used for performing the 2 Point Correlation Function and Voronoi Tesselations on the Milky Way Stellar Halo from Gaia EDR3 Data. It also performs a KS test, and generates a fake background sample using the inverse sample transform. A Color-Magnitude Diagram is created for the selected sample.
